# SignInSystem
This was a project that I did over the summer to assist my FSAE team in organization. This project utilizes python's Flask library and basic HTML. 

This project consists of multiple different site links and is currently being ran on a Raspberry PI locally at my university. Any number of team members are capable of signing in and create tasks, submit workorders, or even submit part orders. 

# Future Work 
        - Make the webpages more modular and easy to adjust
        - Remove unnessary white space in order forms
        - Upon export all files are moved into the teams google drive area
        - Create user accounts for team memebers with different levels of accessability
        - In the task page be able to plot the number of hours spent and hide completed tasks
